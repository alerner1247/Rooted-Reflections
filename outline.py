# Welcome
# Here we want a pygame screen that says welcome, and a button that takes us to the next page

# Choose if you want to input data or view garden
# Four buttons, one that takes you to our input data screen, one that takes you to the garden, 
# one that takes you to past gardens, one that takes you to music


# Input data and transfer data to garden
# You should only be able to input data once each day


# View garden
# Get text entry to appear when plant is clicked


# Music to play, different songs the user can choose which one to play
